Cyber Security Base: Project 1

Web application for signing up to an event

Baseline functionality: add signup (name + address): after signing up, view "done" page

Plan: add A3 xss, A8 csfr (incl. A5 security misconfig), A6 sensitive data exposure?, A7 function level access control 

Added A7: missing function level access control. Link to view all participants is only visible when logged in, but by going directly to localhost:8080/signups one can view these, withoutbeing logged in as admin. I think this also constitutes A6: sensitive data exposure as you can get hold of names and addresses. Other way to get to A6: admin password is short and in the top10000, so easy to crack

Fix A7: uncomment line //.antMatchers("/signUps/**").authenticated() in security  configuration
Fix A6: change admin password to something more sensible. Come up with a sensible passwd, bcrypt hash it (https://www.dailycred.com/article/bcrypt-calculator) using 10 rounds, and insert it to custom user details configuration as the admin password

Add A8: CSFR (incl. A5: security misconfiguration)
	security misconfiguration: CSFR protection is disabled (for some strange reason:O)
	Enables CSFR: deleting participants 

Add A3: xss. Change signups page so that signup name and address are shown unsanitized (change th:text to th:utext). Still, cookies are htmlOnly, so can't access those. This means that xss and CSFR are still pretty useless, as CSFR attacks can't get hold of cookies
