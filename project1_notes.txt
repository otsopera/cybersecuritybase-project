Cyber Security Base: Project 1

Web application for signing up to an event

Baseline functionality: add signup (name + address): after signing up, view "done" page

Plan: add A3 xss, A8 csfr (incl. A5 security misconfig), A6 sensitive data exposure?, A7 function level access control 

Added A7: missing function level access control. Link to view all participants is only visible when logged in, but by going directly to localhost:8080/signups one can view these, withoutbeing logged in as admin. I think this also constitutes A6: sensitive data exposure as you can get hold of names and addresses. Other way to get to A6: admin password is short and in the top10000, so easy to crack
